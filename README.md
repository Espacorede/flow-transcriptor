# flow-transcriptor

This is an utility made to transcribe mediawiki flow topic-based talk pages into old-style pure wikitext pages for the Team Fortress Wiki.

The basic part of the code is based on the same old bot that I used to measure "outdatedness" of translations ages ago and it uses [jsonparser](https://github.com/buger/jsonparser) for easy reading of API JSON responses. (As well as [sanitize](https://github.com/kennygrant/sanitize) for saving filenames)
